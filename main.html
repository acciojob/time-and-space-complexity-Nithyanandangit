	<h1>Learn about Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of its input. Instead of measuring actual execution time (which can vary based on hardware and software), it quantifies the number of operations performed, providing an objective metric for algorithm efficiency and scalability, also use it efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures the total memory an algorithm uses relative to input size \(n\), comprising input space and auxiliary space (extra/temporary storage). Expressed in Big O notation, it helps evaluate efficiency, often balancing with time complexity. Common types include \(O(1)\) (constant/in-place), \(O(n)\) (linear), and \(O(n^{2})\) (quadratic). </p>
